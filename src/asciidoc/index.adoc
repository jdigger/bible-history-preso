== Agenda

* Gathering the Cannon
* The Church and The Word
* Translations

image::BibleReading_1400.jpeg[]

== Gathering the Cannon

== "`Cannon`"

"`rule`" (as in ruler), "`straight line`", standard

== "`Bible`"

"`The Book`" or "`The Books`" (useful ambiguity in English on plurality)

== The Baseline

The seed was the Torah/Pentateuch (the Books of Moses; the first five books)

== The Source

The Cannon is not established by the Church, but the Church has "`recognized`" the Word of God

[.smaller]
NOTE: This seems like a silly distinction, but the order/hierarchy matters. For example, can the Church (such as the Roman Catholic Church) decide what is and isn't a book of the Bible?

== Scope of the Old Testament

The scope of the Old Testament was set not only by the recognition of the Old Testament Church, but by Christ Himself on several occasions

[.smaller]
NOTE: the books were numbered and arranged a little differently for the Hebrews than we do today, but it was identical in content

== Scope of the New Testament

The New Testament was commissioned by Christ, along with the guarantee of their accuracy

[.smaller]
NOTE: e.g., https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016:12-15&version=NIV[John 16:12-15] - they would be reminded of what He said, and told of more by the Holy Spirit

== "`Other Writings`"

There were lots of other writings -- including extremely good and Godly books

[.smaller]
NOTE: Think, for example, of Augustine, Luther, Spurgen. They aren't Scripture (the authors would be appalled the question would be raised) but are extremely useful

The Apocrypha ("`hidden ones`") fall into that category, and were a part of most Bibles until the end of the 19th century (and many are still part of Catholic Bibles)

== Establishing The New Testament

The New Testament was largely letters written to churches around the world

[.smaller]
NOTE: While 20 of the 27 were recognized pretty much as soon as they were written, a few others either weren't well distributed, or had potential issues calling them into question (such as https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+2%3A14-26&version=NKJV[James ch 2] seeming to contradict the _Sola Gratia_ and _Sola Fide_ message of Gospel)

[%notitle]
== NT Established
The years (including increased access to vastly more information than they had) have only further cemented the veracity of the books of the Cannon


== A New Book?

image::Mohammed_receiving_revelation_from_the_angel_Gabriel.jpg[role="left",height="200px"]

According to Muhammad, the verses of the Quran ("`Recitation`") were revealed to him through the archangel Gabriel on many occasions between 610 AD until his death in 632

Muslims believe that parts of the previously revealed scriptures, the Torah and the Gospels, had become distorted

The Quran is viewed by Muslims as the final and literal revealed word of God

[.smaller]
NOTE: Although the Quran is the last verbatim of God towards mankind, communication with God is an ongoing process where "`friends of God`" could communicate with God to know God's will and interpret the Quran.

== Recovered Writings?

image::The_Hill_Cumorah_by_C.C.A._Christensen.jpeg[role="right",height="200px"]

Joseph Smith said that he was led to ancient golden plates buried in Manchester, New York, revealing prophetic writings giving to the American continent between 600 BC and 421 AD

He translated them and published in 1830

== The Church and The Word

== Our Citizenship

In his 22 volume masterpiece in the wake of Rome falling (410), Saint Augustine laid the foundations of our understanding of where our citizenship truly is

== What the Bible Says on Citizenship

[.smaller]
* https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+18%3A36&version=NKJV[John 18:36] - Jesus answered, "`My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, My servants would fight, so that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now My kingdom is not from here.`"

[.smaller]
WARNING: Great, but while we're living in THIS world, how are we to live?

[.smaller]
* https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+13%3A1-7&version=NKJV[Romans 13:1-7] - Let every soul be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist are appointed by God. Therefore whoever resists the authority resists the ordinance of God, and those who resist will [a]bring judgment on themselves. For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Do you want to be unafraid of the authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from the same. For he is God's minister to you for good. But if you do evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is God's minister, an avenger to execute wrath on him who practices evil. Therefore you must be subject, not only because of wrath but also for conscience's sake. For because of this you also pay taxes, for they are God's ministers attending continually to this very thing. Render therefore to all their due: taxes to whom taxes are due, customs to whom customs, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor.

[.smaller]
WARNING: But what about when the governing authorities have fallen? Isn't it a good opportunity to build new Godly ones? Shouldn't taxes etc be used for Godly purposes?

== Joining With Christ and His Church

The Church, of which Christ is the head, is the earthly manifestation of Christ

As such, the best way to join with Christ is to join with the Church

== The Rise Christendom

This was the seed for "`Christendom`" -- with "`The Church`" becoming a unifying worldly governing authority

[%notitle]
== Church Governance

_... a quick diversion into how Church governance became defined ..._

== The Start of Unity

During the period between the Old Testament and the New Testament, Alexander the Great conquered and "`Hellenized`" a large chunk of Europe, Africa, and Asia. This brought political, trade, language, etc. unity throughout the region.

His teacher, Aristotle, had developed the basis for what we now call Logic and Science, bringing unity to thought and understanding not only this world, but the next. (Which https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A1-13&version=NKJV[John 1] famously leans heavily on.)

== Rise of Rome

When Rome took over, they kept and expanded what Alexander and Aristotle had done

image::2016spring_roman-empire-reconsidered_1920x1080.jpeg[height="400px"]

== Rich Soil for the Gospel

image::tower-of-babel-smetekscience-photo-library.jpeg[role="right",height="200px"]

God used the evils of the Greeks and the Romans to prepare the way, "`undoing`" Babel so that His Word could spread rapidly and clearly throughout the the world

== Emperor Constantine the Great

* Before his conversion in 312, Christianity had a "`strained`" relationship with the Empire, but now it was favored
* He was the one that called for the Council of Nicaea (in 325) to unify Christian doctrine, leading to the Nicaean Creed
* He moved the capitol from Rome to Byzantium (which he renamed to Constantinople, and is now known as Istanbul in modern Turkey)

IMPORTANT: That move is generally seen as the shift from the Roman Empire to the Byzantine Empire, and the split between "`classical antiquity`" to the "`Middle Ages`"

== The Holy Episcopal Sees (Jurisdictions)

image::Pentarchy_565_CE.png[role="right",height="500px"]
There were five major episcopal sees of the Roman Empire: Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem

== Islamic Conquests Change the Map

image::Pentarchy_year_1000.jpg[role="right",height="420px"]
The Islamic conquests of Alexandria, Jerusalem, and Antioch in the 7th century left Rome and Constantinople as the only major Christian communities left

== The Holy Roman Empire

The Holy Roman Empire officially started when Charlemagne reconquered much of Europe and was crowned Emperor by the Pope on Christmas Day, 800 AD

He explicitly wanted to recreate the imperial rule of the Caesars and the building on earth of St. Augustine's City of God

== A Strained Relationship

To say things got merely "`extremely complex`" is a huge understatement, but that quickly led to strains between the East and West

[.smaller]
NOTE: Ever wonder why is it that the Gospels were all written in Greek during the height of the "`actual`" Roman empire, but when we in the West think of "`the language of the Church`" -- including for "`ancient`" documents -- it's always Latin?

[.smaller]
NOTE: Or why, even though the vast, vast majority of scholarship, trade, etc. happened in Constantinople and that region, that Rome largely "`took over`"?

== The Eastern Orthodox Church

image::Ayasofya_2006-1.jpeg[role="left",height="440px"]
In 1040 AD, as the Eastern Patriarch was preparing to celebrate the Lord's Supper, the Pope's representative entered the cathedral and placed a letter on the altar, excommunicating the Patriarch and all who followed him

That "`officially`" created the Eastern Orthodox Church

[%notitle]
== Church Governance return

_... back to doctrines about the Bible ..._

== Knowing God

Just as Christ acts as the principle interpreter of God for the Church, so the Church acts as the principle interpreter of Christ for the Christian

[.smaller]
NOTE: Christ sent the Holy Spirit to do that work, which Augustine fully affirmed, but that's so intangible that it becomes a very practical problem of knowing who's led by the Spirit and who's led by a demon. So the Church would be the arbiter and teacher of how to understand the Spirit's guidance.

== Infallibility of the Catholic Church

image::Lusenberg-Virgin.jpg[role="right",height="500px"]
This gave rise over the centuries to the doctrine of the "`infallibility`" of the Catholic Church, further cementing that the individual could *only* understand the Bible by way of the Church

== Church Doctrines

There is a tremendous amount of the Gospel that is not word-for-word explicit in the Bible, but still expressed by the Word

This "`distillation`" of what the Word teaches is what's known as Church Doctrine

[.smaller]
NOTE: A prime example would be the Trinity, which would be formally declared as we understand it in the https://www.crcna.org/welcome/beliefs/creeds/nicene-creed[Nicene Creed]

image::Shield-Trinity-Scutum-Fidei-variations.png[height="200px"]

== Doctrinal Differences

There have always been disagreements on doctrine. One of the earliest and most pervasive (and still enormously influential) was Gnosticism. (e.g., https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+6%3A20-21&version=NKJV[1 Timothy 6:20-21], https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+2%3A8&version=NKJV[Colossians 2:8])

This is why the Church has always had Councils and the like to hold each other accountable to the Word, as https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%202&version=NKJV[Paul did with Peter].

[.smaller]
NOTE: The most famous "`recent`" Council for our modern world was the Council of Trent (1543), which formally removed any chance of reconciliation between the Catholic and Reformation churches. It explicitly condemned the doctrines rediscovered by Luther, Calvin, etc that had gotten corrupted in the Catholic Church over the centuries.

== Font of Knowledge

Since the church was about the only keeper of any of the knowledge that had come before -- and actively repressed anything that it thought would be potentially frivolous or dangerous -- it had a monopoly on effectively ALL learning

== Knowing Better

Not only was it unwise to question Catholic teachings because of possible damnation (or persecution), but because the church likely *_really did_* know better than you

Over the course of over a thousand years that dependency ingrained a tremendous amount of fundamental faith in the "`presumptive authority`" of the church's teachings

== Unthinkable

The church had an answer for everything (especially once Scholasticism came on the scene), so seeking an answer from anywhere other than established church teachings on the subject was -- very literally -- unthinkable

























== Translations

image::Collection_of_Bibles_and_New_Testaments.jpg[height="500px"]

== The  Vulgate (382)

image::310px-Domenico_Ghirlandaio_-_St_Jerome_in_his_study.jpg[role="left",height="200px"]
image::503px-Gutenberg_bible_Old_Testament_Epistle_of_St_Jerome.jpg[role="right",height="200px"]
St. Jerome's collection and translation of the Bible into Latin was by far the best the Western Church had for a thousand years

* This is what Gutenberg printed (1450s)
* The Council of Trent (1545-1563) declared it to be the authentic version of the Bible, even though well before then scholars such as Erasmus had been showing issues with it based on the archeology and scholarship of the Renaissance

[.smaller]
NOTE: This is still the official Bible of the Latin Church, though the current one (1979) is the _Nova Vulgata_

== The Black Death (1346-1353)

image::Blackdeath2.gif[role="left",height="300px"]

image::Danse_macabre_by_Michael_Wolgemut.png[role="right",height="300px"]

The Black Death wiped out ⅓-½ of the population of Europe (ranging as "`low`" as 25% to as high as 80% depending on the the region)

[.smaller]
NOTE: The worst known pandemic in history, the main driver -- the bubonic plague -- still exists, and there have been outbreaks in this (the 21st) century


== Wycliffe (1384)

image::John_Wycliffe_at_work.jpg[role="left",height="300px"]
John Wycliffe translated the Vulgate into English so the common person could read it

Not only was it then clear that Church practice did not match the Word, the recovery of better sources showed that it was far worse than anyone thought

== Fighting Heresy

image::963px-Wycliffe_bones_Foxe.jpg[role="right",height="400px"]
Wycliffe was declared a heretic at the Council of Constance in 1415 -- that all his works should be burned. The Church passed a ruling that anyone who read the Scriptures in English "`would forfeit land, cattle, life and goods from their heirs forever.`"

[.smaller]
While he escaped capture (he said the king was Christ's vicar, not the Pope, getting the protection he needed), but his remains were later exhumed and burned

The Spanish Inquisition was established in 1478 and would remain in force until 1834, more than 350 years later.

== Becoming Increasingly Obvious The World Is Not What We Thought

* Copernicus and Leonardo da Vinci were Luther's contemporaries
* Emperor Charles V has conquistadors conquering the New World and had Magellan circumventing the globe, and France was allied with the Ottomans
* Advances in archeology, science, literature (Utopia, Shakespeare, The Prince, etc), the growing power and wealth of the middle-class...

== Luther's Translation

image::485px-Statue_of_Martin_Luther,_St._Mary's_Church,_Mitte,_Berlin.jpg[role="left",height="500px"]
The next major translation was Luther's into German

[.smaller]
NOTE: focussing on English translations, but obviously this gets into the Reformation, which is a MUCH larger topic...

== Tyndale

William Tyndale was Luther's contemporary and used many of the same sources as Luther to help create his English version, which became the first English Bible with the benefit of the printing press

[.smaller]
NOTE: Tyndale had to do his work under the protection of German princes, though he was eventually captured, tortured, strangled, and his body burned at the stake.

== The "`Great Bible`"

Miles Coverdale, an assistant of Tyndale, completed his work and published The Great Bible (1535) at the time of Henry VIII, which was approved by the Church of England

[.smaller]
NOTE: This later became the Bishop's Bible

== The Geneva Bible

A later revision of the Great Bible was the Geneva Bible, which used increasingly better scholarship of sources.

Not approved by the Church of England, it became the Bible of the Reformed churches (such of the Pilgrims and Puritans), Shakespeare, and the common man.

== The King James Version

The King James Version was commissioned to resolve the differences between the Bishop's Bible and the Geneva Bible.

With relatively minor revisions, it survived *four centuries* as *_the_* English translation, combining accuracy with beauty of expression.

== The 20th Century

By the middle of the 20th century, increased scholarship/sources and changes in the English language have produced a number of new translations












== Conclusion

[%notitle]
== The Word Is Preserved

image::Jesus_receiving_sinner.jpg[role="right",height="500px"]
Throughout the centuries, the Word of God has stood constant, withstanding attacks from within and without the Church

Even through enormous dark times, https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+50%3A20&version=NKJV[He has turned Man's evil to His good]

It is now for our time and generation to pass on the message and heritage of Salvation that He has given us














== Discussion

* How can we be so confident we have received the Word of God, especially in light of Gnosticism, the Quran, the Book of Mormon, Scientism, etc? (e.g., https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+119%3A105&version=NKJV[Psalm 119:105], https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204&version=NKJV[1 John 4], https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+11%3A13-15&version=NKJV[2 Corinthians 11:13-15], https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+17%3A10-11&version=NKJV[Acts 17:10-11], https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+John+1%3A7-11&version=NKJV[2 John 1:7-11])
* Which is worse: A psychopath, or a heretic? (e.g., https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+10:28&version=NKJV[Matthew 10:28], https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+12:4&version=NKJV[Luke 12:4], https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+24:14-16&version=NKJV[Leviticus 24:14-16], https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+18%3A15-17&version=NKJV[Matthew 18:15-17])
